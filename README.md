# Advent of Code 2024 (Kotlin)

Using the challenge to learn Kotlin as I had no experience with it.
- attempting TDD where possible but not refactoring that much as I should.
- attempting functional approach as much as possible
- not using external libraries if possible, using kotlin.test
- avoiding metadata programming as much as possible (f.e. parametrized tests, injections, ...)
- for the sake of testing not caring that much about enforced encapsulation
- sometimes overengineering for the sake of learning / trying new constructs
